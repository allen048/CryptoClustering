# Crypto Clustering Challenge

This assignment involved loading and preparing data for cryptocurrencies affected by 24-hour or 7-day price change analysis. Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens. They are a type of digital currency that allows people to make payments directly to each other through an on-line system. 

I imported the required libraries and dependencies using Python and unsupervised learning. I created dataframes, line charts, and scatter plots to visualize the dataset to determine Clustering and Principal Component Analysis(PCA). In addition, I used K-Means a clustering algorithm used in unsupervised machine learning for the original scaled data and PCA data to determine the optimal K value. Along with the visualizations, I was able to compare the results.

Clustering analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each than to those in other groups.
