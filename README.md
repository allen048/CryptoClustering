# Crypto Clustering Challenge

This assignment involved loading and preparing data for cryptocurrencies affected by 24-hour or 7-day price change analysis. Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens. They are a type of digital currency that allows people to make payments directly to each other through an on-line system. 

Clustering analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each than to those in other groups. PCA is a statistical procedure that allows you to summarize the information content in large data tables by means of a smaller set of "summary indices" that can be more easily visualized and analyzed.

I imported the required libraries and dependencies using Python and unsupervised learning. I created dataframes, line charts, and scatter plots to visualize the dataset to determine Clustering and Principal Component Analysis(PCA). In addition, I used K-Means a clustering algorithm used in unsupervised machine learning for the original scaled data and PCA data to determine the optimal k values. I used hvplot 
to create two line charts with their inertia values and optimal k values. Also, I used hvplot to create two scatter plots with their data. Along with the visualizations, I was able to compare the results to answer the questions provided in jupyter notebook.
